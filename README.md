### <img width="200px" src="MNCreateTitlePage.png" alt="Create Title Page" style="vertical-align:top; margin-right:10px"> MN CREATE TITLE PAGE
* **MN Create Title Page** automatically creates a professional-looking title page from the Title, Subtitle and Composer information entered on your score
* It lets you choose from a number of different templates/styles, many of which have been loosely modelled on professional music publishers’ house styles.
* **MN Create Title Page** will also, if required, automatically create a ‘front matter page’, with boilerplate text entered for you to populate (e.g. programme note, performance notes, instrumentation, etc.)
* **NOTE**: the bundled templates require commonly available fonts. Many of these fonts come with Mac OS X and/or Windows, or are installed by Microsoft Office. Some may need to be manually installed. See below for links to font downloads.

## <a id="use"></a>How to use
* **MN Create Title Page**: 
    * Before running this plug-in, make sure you have the default box (‘vertical frame’) at the top of your first page of music with the correct title, subtitle (e.g. ‘for string quartet’) and your/the composer’s name. The plug-in will use this information to create a new, styled title page.
    * Adding an image can be another nice touch. Once you’ve created your title page, right-click anywhere in the title page frame and choose Add→Image, then select an image from your hard-drive. Once added, you’ll need to resize the image (in Properties) and drag it into the correct location.

* **MN Make Recommended Layout Changes**:
    * You can run this plug-in at any time; however, it’s recommended that you have added all of the instruments you will need, and have at least two systems of music entered.



## <a id="feedback"></a>Feedback, requests and bug reports

* Please send all feedback, feature requests and bug reports to michael.norris@vuw.ac.nz

* For bug reports, especially the ‘non-completion bugs’ mentioned above (i.e. the final dialog box does not show), **please send me your MuseScore file and the name of the plug-in.**
